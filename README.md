# 👋 Hi, I’m @Sfabricito
- 🚀 Always trying to learn something new or different.
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Startups and Cryptocurrencies.
- 🎒 I'm a student of Computation Engineering at [TEC](https://www.tec.ac.cr/).
- 🛸 Also, I'm on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sfabricito), but I don't have anything interesting there.
